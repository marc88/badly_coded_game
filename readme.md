This is a basic game written in python. This was created at random without incorporating proper modularization. 
This will be refactored to include classes and modules and, written into a new code file.

Requirements:
*  Multiple enemy blocks should fall off from the top and should have blue color
*  Starting positions of the enemy blocks should be random
*  The player should only be able to move left or right and should have a red color.
*  The background color should be black.
*  There should be score keeping on the game display window
  -  The score is incremented by 1, for each block completely falling off the display window.
  -  The enemy blocks should fall faster with an increasing score.
  -  There should be enemy and player collision detection enabled, at which moment the scoring and the game stops.
